# spotify

Music Player using firebase for the database, implements firebase authentication for login and firestore to store music data. 

## Getting Started

This project uses state management Bloc (Cubit) and has implemented a clean architecture so that it can be maintained for the long term. In addition, a database in the form of an API is also added which indicates that this project can also implement http dependency (using reqres.in api), but only implements the get concept because other methods do not change the contents of reqres.in itself.
